        info: 'I think most people would agree that real estate almost always appreciates over time. What seems to be missed is the fact that most people only invest in one piece of property at a time, their home. Recent reports are showing that the average time an American is spending in a new home is around 10 years. If something happens to the market then that amount of time may be to low in order to build the wealth that a homeowner would expect. The goal of my application is to give potential homeowners another tool that will help them decide to move on purchasing a home. It will help them by taking in relevant data that has shown to affect appreciation in the past and compute that data to give a potential homeowner an easily digestible number. The number represents the likelihood of that property appreciating in the short to mid future. Hopefully this helps potential homeowners put aside fears of financial lose when deciding on a home purchase.',
